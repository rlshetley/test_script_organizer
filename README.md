Test Script Organizer
=====================

Test Script Organizer provides a way for software test teams to maintain and track manual test scripts. I was tasked with writing smoke tests for a project.  There were no good tools that were freely available that would allow me to create manual test suites and perform test runs.  Test Script Organizer will allow users to create manual test scripts, then later execute test sessions and store the results of these sessions.

The application runs a Django-based backend with an AngularJS front-end.  It was developed as a way for me to become familiar with Python and AngularJS.

## Python Libraries
* Django
* Django REST Framework

## Client-Side Packages
* AngularJS

## TODO
This is a work in progress.  I have several tasks I would like to do to get the application fully functional.

* Get user administration fully functional
* Upgrade all JavaScript libraries (ex. AngularJS 1.3)
* Add unit tests
* Add ETE tests
* Create setup instructions/scripts
* Research and use user interface tables (Currently, I am using simple HTML tables)
* Create more robust role system (Right now there are admin users and all other users)
* Add better security
